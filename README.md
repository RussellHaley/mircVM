# mircVM

The Mercy VM is a prototype "C Virtual Machine" based on the MIR VM and the C To MIR compiler, both of which are created by Vladimir Makarov. The purpose of this project it to gain experience working with MIR and deduce how difficult it would be to maintain a 32 bit variant, especially one capable of running on an arm-none-eabi (bare metal) platform (e.g Arm M4)
