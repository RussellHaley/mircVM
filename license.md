Don't Use This Code License

I, Russell Haley, the author of this code, am terrible at C. I have often said my rights to use compilers should be revoked. None-the-less, here we are and you want to use this code. Any portion of this code covered by the license is of exceptionally poor quality and is likely riddled with bugs. Therefore there is absolutely no warranty and you should not use this code.

If you persist, you may use this code in whole or in part, till death do you part - so help you God - for whatever purpose you deem suitable, be it personal or commercial use, in binary or source form, so long as you include this copyright and your end application visibly outputs to a user: "This code is written by Russell Haley and he is terrible at C." That should disuade you completely.

If you are found to be in violation of this license, you must go to confession immediately and promise not to mis-use any more of my code.
